# __WIDE__

### __Challenge Info__

> We've received reports that Draeger has stashed a huge arsenal in the pocket dimension Flaggle Alpha. You've managed to smuggle a discarded access terminal to the Widely Inflated Dimension Editor from his headquarters, but the entry for the dimension has been encrypted. Can you make it inside and take control?

For this challenge we are given an ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable x86-64 file called __wide__ and a file named __db.ex__.

When we execute the __wide__ file with __db.ex__ as a parameter we are prompted with the following:

Since the challenge info refer to the Flaggle Alpha dimension, let's select its correspondent number (__`6`__).

_Program output_

By selecting the dimension number __`6`__ (Flaggle Alpha), the program asks us for the `WIDE decryption key`.

Let's now open the executable file __wide__ in [Ghidra](https://ghidra-sre.org/ "Ghidra") to decompile the program.

After opening __wide__ in Ghidra and selecting the *main* function, let's go to the decompiler section to see if we can find some useful information.

_main function in Ghidra_

In the *main* function we see some code responsible for displaying some error messages if we don't run the program with the right parameters and also some code responsible for printing the text that we see when the program is being executed.
In line 45, we can see that a function named *menu* is called so let's take a look at what that function does.

_menu function in Ghidra_

Looking at the function *menu*, we can see that in line 152, a string comparison is being made using [`wcscmp`](https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cwchar/wcscmp/ "wcscmp") to see if our input matches the string __`sup3rs3cr3tw1d3`__.
So now let's input the string __`sup3rs3cr3tw1d3`__ when the program asks us for the `WIDE decryption key`.

_Program output the flag_

And we get the flag __`HTB{str1ngs_4r3nt_4lw4ys_4sc11}`__
