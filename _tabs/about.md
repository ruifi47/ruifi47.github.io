Hi! My name is Rui (a.k.a. `ruifi47`) and I'm a 23yo student from Porto (ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹ Portugal), currently finishing my MSc in Information Security @ [University of Porto](https://up.pt). My interests span across a wide range of fields within information security, with a particular focus on the offensive aspect.

I actively participate in [CTF](https://ctftime.org/ctf-wtf/) competitions as a member of [xSTF](https://ctftime.org/team/15341/) or [ransoware](https://ctftime.org/team/218596). For now, in this blog, you can find writeups for some CTF challenges I've previously solved. Also you can check the [CTF-solves repository](https://github.com/ruifi47/CTF-solves) in my github, for a collection of solutions of more CTF challenges that I've pwned.

Hopefully you can learn something new! &#128516;
